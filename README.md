# Infrared_remote_hack
This project will help you decode any  IR remote signal code into hexadecimal code.

Note that this code could also be used with other output devices like relays,servos,etc to create more interesting applications.

## Hardware needed
* Arduino Uno
* TSOP-1738 infrared sensor

## precautions
* Do not change the baud rate of serial monitor
* Try pressing buttons of remote multiple times to make sue the specific buttone code.
* Do not hold the remotr button for too long
